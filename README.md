# Stereo Vision
Project for capture of stereographic videography using cheap (very cheap) components.

## Project Preface
Recently I purchased a couple of cheap action cameras from Aliexpress, very similar to the goPro series of camera for a fraction of the price. One of things I had in mind when I purchased these cameras is to create a rig and some software to perform stereographic video recording. This repository will document this project and its related resources.
